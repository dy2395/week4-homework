I have created this website for a coding quiz with timer. <br/> 
When click Start Quiz button, a timer starts and 3 quiz questions will be presented one by one after you choose an answer and click the Next Que button. <br/>
If a wrong answer is selected, 10 seconds will be subtracted from the timer. <br/>
Either all the questions are answered or the timer reaches 0, the result score will be shown. <br/>
You can save your initials and score, restart the quiz, or clear the records. <br/>
